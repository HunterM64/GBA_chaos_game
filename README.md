# Chaos Game for Gameboy Advance

Simple GBA game that plays the chaos game, resulting in the Sierpinski triangle.

[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbKtFN71Lfs&ab_channel=Numberphile) was the video I watched that inspired me to make this program. 

# Dependencies 

I used the gba-dev toolkit from devkitPro to compile this code into a gba file. 

See the [Getting Started](https://devkitpro.org/wiki/Getting_Started) page for installation details.

While not a dependency, [Tonc](https://www.coranac.com/tonc/text/) is a great resource for learning GBA programming. 

# Compiling

From the same directory that `chaos.c` is located in, run the command
```
make
```

# Running

Simply run the `chaos.gba` file from your favorite emulator. You can even run it on original hardware using something like a flash cartridge if you're based.
